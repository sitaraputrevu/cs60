;; make-range-predicate: returns a function that checks if a value is in range
;;   inputs: low - the low (exclusive) lower bounds, number
;;           high - the high (exclusive) upper bounds, number
;;   output: a function that takes one input and returns true 
;;           if the input is between the values low and high
;;           (and returns false if the input is less than or 
;;           equal to low or is greater than or equal to high)
